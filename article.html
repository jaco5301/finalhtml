Distant planets' atmospheres may give us a glimpse at life contained within.

Astronomers have long searched for conclusive evidence of life be- yond Earth's atmosphere. Research presented at the 2013 European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) may lead us one step closer to answering the question, "Are we alone in the universe?"

According to Lee Grenfell, a professor at the German Aerospace Center's Institute of Planetary Research, signs of life on Earth are found not only on its surface, but also in its atmosphere. For ex- ample, microbes produce nitrous oxide and methane, and oxygen from plants contributes largely to our ozone layer. These biomarkers can tell us a lot about the kinds and quantities of life on a planet's surface, the researchers explain. Theoretically, if we can identify atmospheric biomarkers on a distance planet, we should be able to determine that the planet supports life.

Biomarkers affect light passing through a planet's atmosphere, which means that we don't need a physical sample of a planet's air to learn about an atmosphere's chemical makeup. All we need is a really powerful telescope.<br>

Because our existing telescopes are just too weak, we haven't had the opportunity to detect any of these "chemical fingerprints" that would signal the presence of life, explains Grenfell, who presented the research at this year's EPSC. As we develop stronger telescopes, such as the European Extremely Large Telescope that's under construction in Chile, researchers are preparing to take advantage of the advanced technology to search for signs of life.<br>

"The main aim of our work is to assess the possible range of biomarker signals that might be detected by future telescopes," says Grenfell. "To do this, we developed computer models of exoplanets which simulate the abundances of different biomarkers and the way they affect the light shining through a planet's atmosphere."<br>

Even with the aid of highly sophisticated telescopes, astronomers will face several challenges in this search for life. An ozone layer, for instance, is hard to detect if ultraviolet radiation is too weak or too strong, Grenfell says. Additionally, relying on biomarkers requires several assumptions to be true: namely, that conditions for life are the same as on Earth, and that certain chemical patterns definitely signify the presence of life.<br>
